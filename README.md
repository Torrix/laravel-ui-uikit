# UIkit UI preset for Laravel

## Introduction

Laravel by default ships with a UI preset for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). I prefer [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) though, so this is my alternative to the stock presets.

## License

This preset follows the license of Laravel UI itself, and is therefore open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
