# UIkit UI preset for Laravel

![](https://torrix.uk/laravel-ui-uikit.jpg)

**THIS README IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT YET COMPLETE**

Out of the box, Laravel ships with a [UI preset](https://github.com/laravel/ui) for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to make getting your website front-end up and running simple.

Whilst Bootstrap is a very popular front-end framework, with lots of fans, I much prefer a framework called [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) myself. It's modern, clean, well-thought-out, and modular. It's my go-to framework now for websites and web applications, from tiny single-page landing sites, to massive web applications with thousands of users.

This repository contains my alternative to the stock preset that [Laravel UI](https://github.com/laravel/ui) provides.
